    #  Without doing so, external projects will all have to roll their own solution for
    #  redirecting logging, and for validating expected log messages.  However, because the
    #  current implementation of this involves creating an instance variable "@logs" on
    #  EVERY SINGLE TEST CLASS, and because there are over 1300 tests that are written to expect
    #  this instance variable to be available--we can't easily solve this problem right now.

    # redirecting logging away from console, because otherwise the test output will be
    #  obscured by all of the log output
